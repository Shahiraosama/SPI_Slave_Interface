# SPI_Slave_Interface

# INTRODUCTION

> SPI stands for serial peripheral interface

> It provides speed improvement over other serial data protocols such as UART / I2C

> It supports full duplex communication

> It's often used for data transfer between a smart controller and a less smart peripheral device

# Operation :-
- It Was required to implement a single port sync RAM and SPI Slave so that the slave will do some operations depending on the commands provided by the user (master) such as writing or reading from the RAM
